## Description of Project
freeCodeCamp - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page

Build a website using HTML and CSS that is functionally similar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL

## Goals
 - Pass freeCodeCamp tests
 - Use semantic and accesible HTML and CSS
 - Make it responsive
 - Make it actually look good
 - Use some animation, and check for prefers reduced motion
 
## Things I learned
 - &lt;pre> element
 - &lt;code> element
 - better understanding of CSS Combinators
 - fix monospace font size reduction
   - pre, code { font-family: monospace, monospace; font-size: 1em; }
 - transition to animate changes to some properties
 - CSS transform property performs better than changing other properties
   - e.g. translate vs changing top/bottom
   - "Transforms perform better..." <https://css-tricks.com/css-animation-tricks/>
